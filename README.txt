# How to install RVM and Ruby on EC2 Ubuntu instance

# Steps are:
# 1. Installing Git-core
# 2. Installing RVM (with Joe editor - not required)
# 3. Installing all RVM packages before starting installing Ruby;
# 4. Install all packages which for your OS (I'm on Ubuntu, check your specific needs on your OS, not absolutely necessary if RVM packages installed);
# 5. Install Ruby with the needed and preinstalled RVM packages.
# 6. Optinal: If you are using elder Ruby you might need to install Rubygems too.
# 7. Install your gems, for example Rails, but important note: do not use 'sudo' as you would without using RVM.
